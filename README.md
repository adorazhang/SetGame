# Simple Set Game Implementation in C#
> By Qiao "Adora" Zhang (adora91@gmail.com)

Overview
----
This program simulates a [set game].
There are a few assumptions I have made:
  - User input is always valid.
  - Since it's a computer simulation, for each round, a random player will be picked as the first player who finds a set.
  - Cards are randomly generated, i.e. no set of cards are pre-defined.

To Run This Project
